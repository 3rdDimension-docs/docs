**Initial balance** — the amount of money for the test account.

Trading Simulator creates separate trading accounts for each base currency of the instrument. For example, if you chose EUR / USD currency pair, then the account name will be **Account (USD)**, if you select EUR / JPY, then the name will be **Account (JPY)** respectively.

* **Execution Delay** — the length of time between the acceptance of an order and its execution. In the real market, this parameter affects on the slippage. There are 3 options for the delay: _Range_, _Fix_ and _None_ (instant execution).

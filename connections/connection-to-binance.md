# Connection to Binance

The rapid development of crypto technologies pushes on the adaptation of not only market participants but also devs of trading applications. 3rd dimension trading platform continues to expand its list of crypto connections and offers to an increasing number of traders the usage of cool charting and analytical functionality.

We are pleased to introduce the new crypto exchange — **Binance** — in the arsenal of our trading application's connections. It means that now you can trade in crypto-currencies, using a wider trading functionality list:

* **Flexible customization of trading workspaces** with an ability to create Binds of panels and save it as Templates.
* **Time & Sales** panel, allowing to filter the trades over a specified size.
* Placing orders via the powerful **DOM trader** panel.
* **Crypto-balances** panel for checking your wallets.
* **Crypto Order Entry** panel, for convenient opening of crypto orders.
* Various order types, chart types, drawings, and indicators.
* **History Player** panel, that allows conducting manual backtesting of your trading strategy without any risk. More details about it you can read in [our review article](http://thirddimension.exchange/index.php/blog), which reveals the main points of using this module.

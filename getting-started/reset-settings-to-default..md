### How to Reset All Settings to default.

Sometimes all platform's settings need to be reset to default. To do this, close the platform, **Right-click** on 3rd Dimension icon and select **Open File Location** from the context menu.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can save the current settings if you want to return to them later. Just rename your **Settings** folder to something else, like _**Settings\_My**_ etc.
{% endhint %}

&#xNAN;_**Go to the main folder of the platform.**_

_Rename the **Settings** folder_ (for example, Settings1 or Settings\_old). After you rename the folder, run the platform. The new Settings folder will automatically appear with default settings.

Before sending your Settings to developers for checking the problem, add the full settings folder to the ZIP or RAR archive and send it to **support@thirddimension.exchange** with a brief description of your problem.
{% endhint %}

### How to provide Settings for developers (for checking an issue)

#### How to provide Log files?

Moreover, for checking issues our developers can request Log Files. Please go to the **platform's main folder -> Logs -> Serilog -> send the latest file** or several latest files.&#x20;

### How to share your Templates with other traders

{% hint style="success" %}
You can share your templates with other 3rd Dimension traders by sharing template files with them. Template files can be found in the folder **"3rd Dimension -> Settings -> Templates".**

The file to be transferred must be placed in a similar folder on another computer.
{% endhint %}

Recall that in the 3rd Dimension platform, all created templates are stored in the Control Center sidebar in the **"Templates"** group. Thus, you can launch any template from this location at any time with a single click. You can place your saved templates in the Favorites panel in the Control Center, just like any other default panel.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is done in exactly the same way as described above, except that we transfer a different file **\3rd Dimension\Settings\Workspaces**

The file to be transferred must be placed in a similar folder on another PC.
{% endhint %}

When you open RSS panel for the first time, you won’t have any feeds available in settings, so you will see the welcome screen where you can decide: whether you wish to set up your feeds list by yourself (**\[FEEDS MANAGER]** button) or start usage by importing one of the proposed feeds.

If you decide to import the proposed feeds, just check the ones, you would like to import and press the **\[LOAD]** button. After that, the selected feeds will be imported into your panel’s settings, and you will get to the news view.

The **\[ CLEAR HISTORY ]** button removes all of the previously imported news from the table.

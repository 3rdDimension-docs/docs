# Single Panel

Standalone panels are the minor elements of any Workspace and they behave just like any usual PC window:

* can be resized and positioned to any place on your screen;
* can stick to each other within their borders when they close enough;
* can stick its size to repeat the dimensions of other panels, while resizing;
* can be collapsed to the OS taskbar as usual windows

### Panel's context menu

Each panel has its **context menu**, located in the left upper corner, right before the Panel’s title.

This menu usually consists of the following functions:

* **Link**. Allows linking multiple panels by common symbol using the Color definition. More details are in the [_**Linking section**_](link-panels.md)**.**
* [**Create Bind**](binds.md). Combine multiple panels into a Super-panel. More details are in the [_**Binds section**_](binds.md).
* **Create Panel.** Open a new panel with the current symbol.\
  You can open the following panels: [**Order Entry**](broken-reference)**,** [**Chart**](broken-reference)**,** [**DOM Trader**](broken-reference)**,** [**Market Depth**](broken-reference)**,** [**Time\&Sales**](broken-reference)**,** [**DOM Surface**](broken-reference)**,** [**TPO Chart**](broken-reference)**,** [**Symbol Info**](broken-reference)
* **Duplicate Panel**. Create an exact copy of the current panel.
* [**Save as Template**](broken-reference). Customize the panel, combine it in a group, or Bind and save it as a template.
* **Apply Template.** Once you created several templates you can apply any of them to this particular panel.

* [**Save as default**](broken-reference)**.** Each panel type comes with default settings, which you can customize to your preference. Select the “_<mark style="background-color:green;">**Set as Default**</mark>_” option, and Quantower will save your current panel's settings, applying them to each new panel of the same type.
* [**Setup Actions**](broken-reference) (only for table panels like Watchlist, Time & Sales, Positions, Working Orders etc.). This feature allows you to set Alerts and implement advanced filtering in table values.
* **Always of Top.** When activated, the '_<mark style="background-color:green;">**Always On Top**</mark>_' feature keeps the active panel above all other panels. The pinned panel remains on top, even when other panels are selected.
* [**Export Data.**](broken-reference) Export data from a chart or table to an external CSV file. This includes price data, indicator values, and table values. Also, you can use the [**HISTORY EXPORTER**](broken-reference) panel.

* **Make Screenshot.** Creates and copies a screenshot of the panel to the clipboard for easy sharing on social networks.
* **Help**. If you have questions about using the panel or its specific features, click on this link and you will immediately redirect to the documentation for this panel.
* **Settings**. Personal settings for each panel. Opens a Settings screen where you can customize your panel. Once set up, you can save these settings as your Defaults if desired.

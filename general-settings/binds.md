# Binds

The most innovative and, we are sure, a useful layer of panels organization — is **Binds** (binding). It was developed to allow a user to create its own “**Super-panels**” — the sets of basic panels that should be stuck together. Generally, Binds allows you to create any combination of panels in any required way; the only limit is your fantasy.

### How to Bind several panels

1. place several panels on your workspace close to each other;
2. select “_**Create bind**_” from any panel’s context menu (this turns the Bind mode on);
3. click on the panels, that you want to bind together or just hold the left mouse button and drag ("draw") over that panels to make them selected in one area;
4. press “_**CREATE BIND**_” button in the right-bottom corner of the Bind area (or hit “Enter” button on your keyboard);&#x20;
5. that is all — now you have your own Super-panel.
